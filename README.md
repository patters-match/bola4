# Bolalela 4 - a commented source

[This game by Beyker Soft](https://bunsen.itch.io/bolalela-4-by-beyker-soft) was an intriguing entry into the [Basic 10Liner competition 2021](https://gkanold.wixsite.com/homeputerium/results-2021).
Somehow it achieves the impossible feat of scrolling an entire playfield both vertically and horizontally in BASIC, with playable performance.

Clearly some sorcery is afoot but, as one might expect, the listing doesn't give up its secrets easily. Typically entries into the 10Liner competition tend to post an accompanying program explanation, but this game did not have one... until now.

This commented listing can be built by [zmakebas](https://github.com/ohnosec/zmakebas) into a functionally identical Spectrum listing to the original, though no longer a ten-liner.

```bash
zmakebas -n "BOLA 4" -o "BOLALELA4.tap" -l -i 10 -a 10 "bolalela4.bas"
```
